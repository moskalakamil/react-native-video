In future versions, URLs with query strings (e.g., test.mp4?resolution=480p) will be supported once dependencies allow access to the Content-Type header.  At this time, HLS playlists (.m3u8) and videos with sideloaded text tracks are not supported and will bypass the cache.  You will see warnings in the Xcode logs when using debug mode. If you're unsure whether your video is cached, check your Xcode logs.  By default, files expire after 30 days, and the maximum cache size is 100MB.  Future updates may include more configurable caching options.  Note: If you are enabling video caching (using $RNVideoUseVideoCaching), you must add the following to your Gemfile: gem &quot;cocoapods-swift-modular-headers&quot; Then, install dependencies using: bundle install bundle exec pod install This enables Swift modular headers for Swift dependencies.

This allows native modules to deeply integrate with the playback system - for example:  replacing the media source factory,modifying the media item before playback starts (e.g., injecting stream keys),disabling caching dynamically per source.  These capabilities are available through the advanced Android plugin interface: RNVExoplayerPlugin.  warning These extension points are optional — if no plugin provides them, the player behaves exactly as it did before.    Plugin Extension Points (Android)​  If your plugin implements RNVExoplayerPlugin, you can override the following methods:  1. overrideMediaItemBuilder​  Allows you to modify the MediaItem.Builder before it’s used. You can inject stream keys, cache keys, or override URIs.  override fun overrideMediaItemBuilder( source: Source, mediaItemBuilder: MediaItem.Builder ): MediaItem.Builder? { // Return modified builder or null to use default }   2. overrideMediaDataSourceFactory​  Lets you replace the data source used by ExoPlayer. Useful for implementing read-only cache or request interception.  override fun overrideMediaDataSourceFactory( source: Source, mediaDataSourceFactory: DataSource.Factory ): DataSource.Factory? { // Return your custom factory or null to use default }   3. overrideMediaSourceFactory​  Allows you to override the default MediaSource.Factory used by ExoPlayer for creating media sources. Use this if you need to inject a custom media source implementation. If you return null, the default media source factory will be used.  override fun overrideMediaSourceFactory( source: Source, mediaSourceFactory: MediaSource.Factory, mediaDataSourceFactory: DataSource.Factory ): MediaSource.Factory? { // Return your custom factory or null to use default }   4. shouldDisableCache​  Enables dynamic disabling of the caching system per source.  override fun shouldDisableCache(source: Source): Boolean { return true // your own logic }     Once implemented, react-native-video will automatically invoke these methods for each &lt;Video /&gt; instance.

You can pass an asset loaded via require or an object with a uri.  Setting the source will trigger the player to attempt to load the provided media with all other given props. Ensure all props are provided before or at the same time as setting the source.  Rendering the player component with a null source initializes the player and starts playing once a source value is provided.  Providing a null source value after loading a previous source stops playback and clears out the previous content.  The documentation for this prop is incomplete and will be updated as each option is investigated and tested.  Asset Loaded via require​  danger On iOS, file names must not contain spaces. For example, my video.mp4 will not work—use my-video.mp4 instead.  Platforms: Android | iOS | visionOS | Windows UWP  Example:  Pass the asset directly (deprecated):  const sintel = require(&quot;./sintel.mp4&quot;); source = { sintel };   Or by using a URI (starting from 6.0.0-beta.6):  const sintel = require('./sintel.mp4'); source={{ uri: sintel }}   URI String​  A number of URI schemes are supported by passing an object with a uri attribute.  All URI strings must be URL encoded. For example, 'www.myurl.com/blabla?q=test uri' is invalid, whereas 'www.myurl.com/blabla?q=test%20uri' is valid.  Web Address (http://, https://)​  Platforms: All  Example:  source={{ uri: 'https://www.sample-videos.com/video/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_10mb.mp4' }}   File Path (file://)​  Platform: Android  Example:  source={{ uri: 'file:///sdcard/Movies/sintel.mp4' }}   Note: Your app will need permission to read external storage if accessing a file outside your app.  File from Asset Folder (asset://)​  Platform: Android  Allows playing a video file from the app's asset folder.  Example:  source={{ uri: 'asset:///sintel.mp4' }}   iPod Library (ipod-library://)​  Platform: iOS  Path to a sound file in your iTunes library, typically shared from iTunes to your app.  Example:  source={{ uri: 'ipod-library:///path/to/music.mp3' }}   Note: Using this feature requires adding an entry for NSAppleMusicUsageDescription to your Info.plist file, as described here.  Explicit MIME Type for Streams​  Provide a type property (mpd/m3u8/ism) inside the source object. This is needed when the URL extension does not match the expected MIME type.  Example (URL extension is .ism for Smooth Streaming, but the file is actually MPEG-DASH (mpd)):  source={{ uri: 'http://host-serving-a-type-different-than-the-extension.ism/manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)', type: 'mpd' }}   Other Protocols​  The following protocols are supported on some platforms but not fully documented yet:content://, ms-appx://, ms-appdata://, assets-library://  Using DRM Content​  Platforms: Android | iOS | visionOS | tvOS  To set up DRM, follow this guide.  Example:  { description: 'WV: Secure SD &amp; HD (cbcs, MP4, H264)', uri: 'https://storage.googleapis.com/wvmedia/cbcs/h264/tears/tears_aes_cbcs.mpd', drm: { type: DRMType.WIDEVINE, licenseServer: 'https://proxy.uat.widevine.com/proxy?provider=widevine_test', }, },   Start Playback at a Specific Point in Time​  Platforms: Android | iOS | web  Provide an optional startPosition for video playback. The value is in milliseconds. If the cropStart prop is applied, it will be applied from that point forward. (If it is negative, undefined, or null, it is ignored.)  Playing Only a Portion of the Video (Start &amp; End Time)​  Platforms: Android | iOS  Provide an optional cropStart and/or cropEnd for the video. Values are in milliseconds. This is useful when you want to play only a portion of a large video.  Example:  source={{ uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8', cropStart: 36012, cropEnd: 48500 }} source={{ uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8', cropStart: 36012 }} source={{ uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8', cropEnd: 48500 }}   Overriding the Metadata of a Source​  Platforms: Android | iOS | tvOS  Provide optional title, subtitle, artist, imageUri, and/or description properties for the video. This is useful when using notification controls on Android or iOS or adapting the tvOS playback experience.  Example:  source={{ uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8', metadata: { title: 'Custom Title', subtitle: 'Custom Subtitle', artist: 'Custom Artist', description: 'Custom Description', imageUri: 'https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1498641868397191170/6qW2XkuI_400x400.png' } }}   ad​  Platforms: Android | iOS  Sets the ad configuration.  Example:  ad: { adTagUrl = &quot;https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/21775744923/external/vmap_ad_samples&amp;sz=640x480&amp;cust_params=sample_ar%3Dpremidpostoptimizedpodbumper&amp;ciu_szs=300x250&amp;gdfp_req=1&amp;ad_rule=1&amp;output=vmap&amp;unviewed_position_start=1&amp;env=vp&amp;impl=s&amp;cmsid=496&amp;vid=short_onecue&amp;correlator=&quot;; adLanguage = &quot;fr&quot;; }   See: ads for more information.  Note: You need to enable IMA SDK in the Gradle or Pod file - enable client-side ads insertion.  contentStartTime​  Platform: Android  The start time in ms for SSAI content. This determines at what time to load the video info like resolutions. Use this only when you have an SSAI stream where the ad resolution is not the same as the content resolution.  Note: This feature only works on DASH streams.  textTracksAllowChunklessPreparation​  Platform: Android  Allow Chunkless Preparation for HLS media sources. See: disabling-chunkless in the Android documentation.  Default value: true.  source={{ uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8', textTracksAllowChunklessPreparation: false, }}   bufferConfig​  Platform: Android  Adjust the buffer settings.

Android only. live\tobject\tObject containing another config set for live playback configuration.  minLoadRetryCount​  Platform: Android  Sets the minimum number of times to retry loading data before failing and reporting an error to the application. Useful for recovering from transient internet failures.  Default: 3. Retries 3 times.  Example:  source={{ uri: 'https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8', minLoadRetryCount: 5 // Retry 5 times. }}   textTracks​  Platforms: Android | iOS | visionOS  Load one or more &quot;sidecar&quot; text tracks. This takes an array of objects representing each track. Each object should have the format:  warning This feature does not work with HLS playlists (e.g., m3u8) on iOS.  Property\tDescriptiontitle\tDescriptive name for the track. language\t2-letter ISO 639-1 code representing the language. type\tMime type of the track.

To understand this prop, you need to understand how view management works. The main View style passed to react-native-video is the space reserved to display the video component. It may not match exactly the real video size. For example, you can pass a 4:3 video view and render a 16:9 video inside. So there is a second view, the video view.  Subtitles are managed in a third view.  When subtitlesFollowVideo is set to true, the subtitle view will adapt to the video view. If the video is displayed out of screen, the subtitles may also be displayed out of screen.When subtitlesFollowVideo is set to false, the subtitle view will adapt to the main view. If the video is displayed out of screen, the subtitles may still remain visible within the main view.  This prop can be changed at runtime.

If you need deferred initialization with the hook: const player = useVideoPlayer({ uri: 'https://example.com/video.mp4', initializeOnCreation: false, }, (_player) =&gt; { _player.onLoad = () =&gt; console.log('Loaded'); }); // Later (e.g. on user tap) await player.initialize(); player.play();  ","version":"v7 Beta","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Buffering & Status Events","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/react-native-video/docs/v7/players/events/buffering","content":"","keywords":"","version":"v7 Beta"},{"title":"onBuffer​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Buffering & Status Events","url":"/react-native-video/docs/v7/players/events/buffering#onbuffer","content":" onBuffer: (buffering: boolean) =&gt; void;   Fired when buffering state changes.  useEvent(player, 'onBuffer', (buffering) =&gt; { setIsBuffering(buffering); });   ","version":"v7 Beta","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"onStatusChange​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Buffering & Status Events","url":"/react-native-video/docs/v7/players/events/buffering#onstatuschange","content":" onStatusChange: (status: VideoPlayerStatus) =&gt; void;   Fired when player status changes.  useEvent(player, 'onStatusChange', (status) =&gt; { console.log('Status:', status); // 'idle' | 'loading' | 'ready' | 'playing' | 'paused' | 'buffering' | 'ended' | 'error' });   ","version":"v7 Beta","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"onBandwidthUpdate​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Buffering & Status Events","url":"/react-native-video/docs/v7/players/events/buffering#onbandwidthupdate","content":" onBandwidthUpdate: (data: BandwidthData) =&gt; void;   Fired when estimated bandwidth changes.  useEvent(player, 'onBandwidthUpdate', (data) =&gt; { console.log('Bandwidth:', data.bitrate, 'bps'); });   ","version":"v7 Beta","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Example​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Buffering & Status Events","url":"/react-native-video/docs/v7/players/events/buffering#example","content":" function BufferingPlayer() { const [status, setStatus] = useState('idle'); const [buffering, setBuffering] = useState(false); const player = useVideoPlayer(source, (_player) =&gt; { _player.play(); }); useEvent(player, 'onStatusChange', setStatus); useEvent(player, 'onBuffer', setBuffering); return ( &lt;View&gt; &lt;VideoView player={player} style={{ width: '100%', height: 300 }} /&gt; {buffering &amp;&amp; &lt;ActivityIndicator /&gt;} &lt;Text&gt;Status: {status}&lt;/Text&gt; &lt;/View&gt; ); }  ","version":"v7 Beta","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Lifecycle","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/react-native-video/docs/v7/players/usage/lifecycle","content":"","keywords":"","version":"v7 Beta"},{"title":"Overview​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Lifecycle","url":"/react-native-video/docs/v7/players/usage/lifecycle#overview","content":" State\tDescriptionCreated\tPlayer exists, may not be initialized Initialized\tNative player ready, source loading Ready\tMedia loaded, ready to play Released\tResources freed, instance unusable  ","version":"v7 Beta","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"initialize()​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Lifecycle","url":"/react-native-video/docs/v7/players/usage/lifecycle#initialize","content":" initialize(): Promise&lt;void&gt;;   Manually initialize the native player.
